# Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. student at Georgia State University. My research interests are in Health Economics, Public Economics, and Development Economics. I am specifically interested in healthcare utilization caused by health insurance and social programs and identifying the effects of healthcare use on health outcomes.
